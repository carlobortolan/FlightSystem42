We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I (do I)
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it (say it)
Inside, we both know what's been going on (going on)
We know the game and we're gonna play it
And if you ask me how I'm feeling
Don't tell me you're too blind to see
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

I wanna hold 'em like they do in Texas, please
Fold 'em, let 'em hit me, raise it, baby, stay with me (I love it)
Love game intuition, play the cards with spades to start
And after he's been hooked, I'll play the one that's on his heart
Oh, whoa, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I got
Oh, whoa, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I got
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)
P-p-p-poker face, f-f-fuck her face (mum-mum-mum-mah)
P-p-p-poker face, f-f-fuck her face (mum-mum-mum-mah)
I wanna roll with him, a hard pair we will be
A little gamblin' is fun when you're with me (I love it)
Russian roulette is not the same without a gun
And baby, when it's love, if it's not rough, it isn't fun (fun)
Oh, whoa, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I got
Oh, whoa, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I got
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)
P-p-p-poker face, f-f-fuck her face (mum-mum-mum-mah)
P-p-p-poker face, f-f-fuck her face (mum-mum-mum-mah)
(Mum-mum-mum-mah)
(Mum-mum-mum-mah)
I won't tell you that I love you, kiss or hug you
'Cause I'm bluffin' with my muffin
I'm not lyin', I'm just stunnin' with my love-glue-gunnin'
Just like a chick in the casino
Take your bank before I pay you out
I promise this, promise this
Check this hand 'cause I'm marvelous
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face

P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face
P-p-p-poker face, f-f-fuck her face (she's got me like nobody)
P-p-p-poker face, f-f-fuck her face (mum-mum-mum-mah)
P-p-p-poker face, f-f-fuck her face (mum-mum-mum-mah)

I wonder if you know
How they live in Tokyo (はい!)
If you seen it, then you mean it
Then you know you have to go
Fast and furious (drift, drift, drift)
Fast and furious (drift, drift, drift)

へいらっしゃい おまちどうさま
喧騒まみれ この街の演奏
黙ったまま一度ついておいで
世界中魅了するほどに豪華な
Japan (what?) 一番 (what?)
Jump around さぁうちらの出番 (what?)
テリヤキ・ボーイズ in the place to be
見せてやる (はい!) オリジナル in the VIP (はい!)
Many-many diamonds dangling
Bag full of money, we strangling
Hate me, fry me, bake me, try me
All the above 'cause you can't get in
I don't want no problem
Because me professional
Make you, shake your ケツ, thank you
Haters take it パーソナル
Like a 金田 対 鉄夫
Neo Tokyo 滅亡 無くなっちまう前に
熱を発散しきっちまおうぜ let's go 熱望
ズヒル木六本ラボからエスコート (ええ すごい)
26 号じゃない Nigo
入力「SOL!」 私のピンポイント

はい わたし テリヤキボーイズ
あっという間吹き飛ばすノイズ
邁進してますんでゲとる!
ファンの数も増えてます
ベーシックはサプライズで
マジ毎日が危ないぜ
忍者風 賢者風だけど芸者
BAPEの惑星からの使者
You should see me in the parking lot
7-11 is the spot
Fights with wings and shiny things
And lions, tigers, bears, oh my god!
We're furious and fast
Supersonic like JJ Phat
And we rock 'cause the wheels are fly
Can't beat that with a baseball bat
Like a 公安九課 トグサ
マテバ 良い是非即採用
インターセプターして
国際的犯罪は万歳
ホラ hands up
ファイルが Bomb 落とすと
踊りだす今夜の 4-Boyz
From ファーイーストコースト どうささやく (私のゴーストは？)

Yeah, Japan毎日 ドキドキです
ヒートアイランド とびとびで
萌える容姿で ぼちぼちね
手招きで誘う こっちこっちへ
ヒートアップで踊りそう
街中すべってのりこむ
めっちゃ変わり者だってシャッフル
ごちゃごちゃの fast and furious
It's gotta be the shoes, gotta be the furs
That's why ladies choose me
All up in the news 'cause we so cute
That's why we so huge-e
Harajuku girls know how I feel
They respect, I keeps it real
Not a China-man 'cause I ain't from China, man
I am Japan-man
私は東京好き (you see me go)
私の車すてき (coming out of the black Benz SLR)
あなたも東京好き (I wonder where he get that kind of money?)
(Don't worry about it) あなたの車すてき (let's go)

We wanna suck up cloud no. 9
In living the dream, we're the first in line
Future is now, we're the new generation - all we want is Liberty of Action
This is what we want - Liberty of Action
What do we want - Liberty of Action
Tell us what you want - Liberty of Action

Do's, don'ts, danger zones, on the streets, in my head
Fear, war, oil for blood. Who is God? - Who is not?
I need a break, please somebody recall
Hell, I'm tired of standing with my back against the wall
So - Tell me what you want - Liberty of Action
So fuck-off, I want - Liberty of Action


Shake your money maker, pay your due
Reach out for the sky, while the skies are blue
I don't wanna die, before I grow old
Gimme time to shine before my blood runs cold

Sorry, Mother Earth, our intentions are clear
Money makes you turn around, so Mother - no fear!
And don't you complain, we're in pre-negotiation
Politics will seek for the final solution!

Anything goes, gotta wheel the big deal
- this is insanity, my head's under the heel!
So someone do something for cloud no.9
If no one does nothing, it's a question of crime!
So tell what we want - Liberty of Action
God dammit, we need - Liberty of Action

Shake your money maker, pay your due
Reach out for the sky, while the skies are blue
I don't wanna die, before I grow old
Gimme time to shine before my blood runs cold

It's now or never - we gotta change the channel!
Is it the light of a train, at the end of the tunnel?

I wanna suck up cloud no.9
I'm living the dream, I'm the first in line
Future is now, we're the new generation - all I want is Liberty of Action
