The étude, like all études by Chopin, is in ternary form (A–B–A), recapitulating the first part. The first part of the middle section introduces chromaticism in the left hand octave melody while the second one modulates to the C major recapitulation via an extended circle of fifths.
The main technical difficulty of this piece is playing the uninterrupted right hand arpeggios, including the swift position changes, in legato powerfully and accurately at the suggested tempo (quarter note = 176) without straining the hand. The momentum of the motion has to be transferred by the outer hand and the fifth finger to the accentuated top notes. French pianist Alfred Cortot (1877–1962) states that the first difficulty to overcome is "stretch and firmness in shifting the hand over nearly the whole length of the keyboard."[13] Exercises introduced by Cortot, Gottfried Galston [de; fr][14] and Alfredo Casella[15] deal mostly with stretch and anticipation of position changes. Ferruccio Busoni in his Klavierübung introduces an exercise for two hands in contrary motion, somewhat reminiscent of Leopold Godowsky.[16] Australian pianist Alan Kogosowski warns against straining the right hand by constant overstretching. To avoid strain, the first note of the position "must be released like a hot potato," and the hand "should move quickly and laterally, without stretching, from the first note to the next note and the next position."[17]

Sergei Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 3 in D minor, Op. 30, was composed in the summer of 1909. The piece was premiered on November 28 of that year in New York City with the composer as soloist, accompanied by the New York Symphony Society under Walter Damrosch.[1] The work often has the reputation of being one of the most technically challenging piano concertos in the standard classical piano repertoire.
The concerto is scored for solo piano and an orchestra consisting of 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets in B-flat, 2 bassoons, 4 horns in F, 2 trumpets in B-flat, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, bass drum, snare drum, cymbals, and strings.
The work follows the form of a standard piano concerto, constructed into three movements. The end of the second movement leads directly into the third without interruption.
Allegro ma non tanto (D minor)
The first movement is in sonata-allegro form. The piece revolves around a diatonic melody which Rachmaninoff claimed "wrote itself".[6][7] The theme soon develops into complex and busy pianistic figuration. The second theme opens with quiet exchanges between the orchestra and the piano before fully diving into the second theme in B♭ major. The first part of the first theme is restated before the movement is pulled into a loud development section in C minor which opens with toccata-like quavers in the piano and reaches a loud chordal section. The whole development exhibits features similar to a canon, such as an eighth note passage in the piano in which the left hand and the right hand play overlapping figures. The movement reaches a number of ferocious climaxes, especially in the cadenza. Rachmaninoff wrote two versions of this cadenza: the chordal original, which is commonly notated as the ossia, and a second one with a lighter, toccata-like style. Both cadenzas lead into a quiet solo section where the flute, oboe, clarinet and horn individually restate the first theme of the exposition, accompanied by delicate arpeggios in the piano. The cadenza then ends quietly, but the piano alone continues to play a quiet development of the exposition's second theme in E♭ major before leading to the recapitulation, where the first theme is restated by the piano, with the orchestra accompanying, soon closing with a quiet, rippling coda reminiscent of the second theme.
Intermezzo: Adagio (D minor → F♯ minor → D♭ major → B♭ minor → F♯ minor → D minor)
The second movement is constructed around a theme and variations, in an ABACA form, while shifting around various home keys. The theme and first two variations are played by the orchestra alone. The piano then plays several variations with and without the orchestra. After the first theme development and recapitulation of the second theme, the main melody from the first movement reappears, before the movement is closed by the orchestra in a manner similar to the introduction. The piano ends the movement with a short, violent "cadenza-esque" passage which moves into the last movement without pause. Many melodic thoughts of this movement allude to Rachmaninoff's second piano concerto, third movement, noticeably the Russian-like E♭ major melody.
Finale: Alla breve (D minor → E♭ Major → D minor → D major)
The third movement is in a modified sonata-allegro form, and is quick and vigorous.The movement contains variations on many of the themes that are used in the first movement, which unites the concerto cyclically. However, after the first and second themes it diverges from the regular sonata-allegro form. There is no conventional development; that segment is replaced by a lengthy digression in E♭ major, which leads to the two themes from the first movement. After the digression, the movement recapitulation returns to the original themes, building up to a toccata climax somewhat similar but lighter than the first movement's ossia cadenza and accompanied by the orchestra. The movement concludes with a triumphant and passionate second theme melody in D major. The piece ends with the same four-note rhythm – claimed by some to be the composer's musical signature – as it is used in both the composer's second concerto and second symphony.

It was not until 1834 or 1835, in Paris, that Chopin added the introduction, given over to the solo piano. Some commentators consider that the two parts – the introductory Andante spianato and the actual Polonaise – do not suit one another, as they are too different. Yet that very diametrical contrast is what seems to link the two parts together.

The Andante spianato has the character of a nocturne, and at the same time of a lullaby. It forges an oneiric mood, from which the listener is only released by the fanfares of the horns announcing the Polonaise. Spianato means evenly, without contrasts, without any great agitation or anxiety. Thus interpreters are put in mind of the mood of a harmonious moonlit night, a landscape dominated by the reflecting surface of a lake, or even the singing of sirens on gently rocking waves or the immersion in a state of unwavering meditation. The arabesque of the piano, wending its way endlessly above the nocturne-like accompaniment, fades away. New music appears – different, though also hushed: songful and melodious, and lightly tripping, but above all focussed and straightforward, played semplice and entirely without pedal. Pauses are then followed by a return to the music of the interrupted nocturne. But that too dies away, giving way for a moment once more to the concentrated chords of that semplice, now frozen in immobile expectation.

The dramatic structure of this work – as a whole – is uncomplicated: the listener has to be drawn into a trance by the magic of music from the boundaries of dream and reality, before being roused, with the sound of the orchestral tutti and the rhythms of the polonaise, to a new life.

What happens in this work as the theme of the polonaise enters has been described in various ways, but always with distinct admiration. For Jan Kleczyński, it is ‘a real firework of wondrous passages and bold phrases’, for Zdzisław Jachimecki ‘a wondrously shimmering play of lights and colours’, and for Tadeusz Zieliński ‘a wealth and magnificence of patterns in sound’.

The formal shape of the Polonaise is not easy to define, as it results from the combining of two principles: the refrain-based form characteristic of a rondo and the reprise-based form peculiar to a dance with trio. Except that the theme of the refrain is altered through variation, and the trio of the dance presents a whole group of themes. As for the texture, two versions of the work came into being: the original version, with the subtle accompaniment of an all-but-absent orchestra, and a second version for solo piano.

The principal theme of the Polonaise combines soaring flight with spirit and verve, bravura with elegance – all of those features that characterise a dance in the style brillant. That opening (and principal) theme is at once developed by a complementary theme that is suffused with harmoniousness and given over to play.

On its return, that distinctly polonaise principal theme takes on a nocturne-like character. Its melody begins to lose itself and diffuse in astonishing fioriture.

The function of episodes is taken on by three themes of differing character and expression. The first, in E flat major, brings to the work a sudden enlivenment: lacy melodic ornaments and figurations are broken up by a gesture of double octaves played forte and risoluto. The second of the episodes, in C minor, brings the mood of a lyrical espressivo. The third, in B flat major, with its chains of sixths and fifths, brings gentle harmoniousness, close to impressionistic effects. As befits a composition in the brillant style, the work is rounded off with a dazzling, refulgent coda.

The end result is a work in grand style, par excellence virtuosic. And that is how it was called when it came to be published: Grande Polonaise Brillante, précédée d’un Andante spianato. Chopin dedicated it to one of his aristocratic pupils, the Baroness d’Est. He first performed it, with marked success, in April 1835, at the Paris Conservatory, in a benefit concert for the then famous Parisian conductorFrançois-Antoine Habeneck. But just as the music of the E flat major Polonaise constituted the final farewell of Chopin the composer to a purely virtuosic style, so that concert was the last grand concert given in Paris by Chopin the virtuoso. As a pianist, he left the grand concert platform, and as a composer he entered the peak phase of his fully mature individual style – a style in which pianistic virtuosity was placed at the service of expression.

The Grande Polonaise Brillante in E flat major, Op. 22, preceded by the Andante spianato, is a magnificent example of the genre. Played with the utmost fluency, subtlety and sensitivity to the beauty of the sound, it confirms the delight of Jan Kleczyński: ‘There is no composition stamped with greater elegance, freedom and freshness’.

Inspired by a trip to Spain in the winter of 1844-1845, Liszt’s Rhapsodie Espagnole embodies his unique genius for creating brilliantly effective piano textures and demonstrates the kinds of musical gestures that made his stage presence so compelling to audiences.

The work opens in high drama, with deep rumblings in the bass issuing into sweeping arpeggios up to the high register where the angelic strumming of celestial harps prepares us for a musical feast of divine inspiration. Liszt begins with the traditional Folies d’Espagne tune, which Rachmaninoff also used in his Variations on a Theme of Corelli, Op. 42. First presented with stark simplicity low down in the bass, like an old man mumbling to himself on a country road, the tune gradually gathers momentum in a series of increasingly animated variations until its elaboration extends over the entire range of the keyboard.

But then, at the peak of all this exuberance, Liszt interrupts the proceedings with a ‘music-box’ effect in the high register, chiming out a playful and childlike jota aragonesa, the popular character of which is reinforced by drone tones in the mid-range. Succeeding variations continue to dazzle and astonish until a tender recitative provides a sentimental pause for lyrical reflection.

His nostrils now flaring widely, Liszt cracks his knuckles to unleash a muscular apotheosis of his two main themes in a concentrated display of bravura that may have you reaching for your opera glasses to verify just how many arms the pianist is using, and how many fingers are attached to each.

Protective headgear is recommended, as chips of ceiling stucco may begin to fall before this piece’s final chords thunder through the hall.

Ludwig van Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 30 in E major, Op. 109, composed in 1820, is the third-to-last of his piano sonatas. In it, after the huge Hammerklavier Sonata, Op. 106, Beethoven returns to a smaller scale and a more intimate character. It is dedicated to Maximiliane Brentano, the daughter of Beethoven's long-standing friend Antonie Brentano, for whom Beethoven had already composed the short Piano Trio in B♭ major WoO 39 in 1812. Musically, the work is characterised by a free and original approach to the traditional sonata form. Its focus is the third movement, a set of variations that interpret its theme in a wide variety of individual ways.[1]

The E minor Partita of J. S. Bach involves one of the most controversial issues among musicologists and performers, the rhythmic interpretation of the last two movements: Tempo di Gavotta and Gigue. There are two views: one supporting duple subdivision of the beat as notated, and another choosing triple subdivision of the beat, which modifies what is notated. In the first chapter, the author discusses the coherent use of three basic motives---a minor second motive, a consecutive descending four-note motive, and a repeated-note motive---in the E minor Partita and the functions and effects of each motive in different movements. In the last two chapters, the author demonstrates how the motivic structure of the piece can influence one's interpretative decisions, such as articulation and grouping and especially rhythmic interpretation of the Tempo di Gavotta and Gigue movements.

Classical music has its share of one-hit wonders, but Max Bruch was not one of them—just ask any fiddler. As she or he will tell you, several of Bruch’s compositions are foundational works in the violin repertory. So we can easily understand Bruch’s exasperation over the popularity of his Violin Concerto No. 1, which captured audiences’ fascination as soon as they heard it, and remains a public favorite to this day. “The G-minor concerto again!” exclaimed Bruch after receiving yet another request to conduct it. “I could not bear to hear it even once more. My friends, play the second concerto or the Scottish Fantasy for once!”

This outburst comes to us by way of the composer’s son Ewald, who might reasonably have expected a financial benefit from the concerto’s popularity. But as far as Bruch and his heirs were concerned, the concerto seemed jinxed. Bruch completed the first version of the concerto in 1866; its premiere, with Otto von Königslow as soloist, was followed by intensive revision. Almost from the moment of the new version’s premiere two years later with the esteemed Joseph Joachim as soloist, the concerto was hugely popular, and from then on Bruch never escaped the shadow of its success.

The revised version is the performing edition we know today. Strapped for funds, Bruch kept a copy of this version of the score for himself, and sold the original score and its rights to his publisher for a relative pittance; there is some doubt as to whether he actually received even that. In the economic turmoil surrounding World War I, the score passed in and out of the hands of various Bruch associates until its final sale to the collection of Pierpont Morgan Library. The one element all these transfers had in common was that they did not benefit Bruch or his family in any way.

The concerto was performed throughout Europe and America in Bruch’s own lifetime, offering audiences precisely what they wanted in a violin concerto: singing lines, passionate phrasing, extreme dynamics, overarching drama, double- and triple-stops. The concerto is marked by Bruch’s characteristic alternation of moods: simmering, soulful melodies build to explosive outbursts of passion. Its opening prelude, in a march rhythm marked allegro moderato, scarcely hints at the energy and drama of the finale, marked allegro energetico. If you’ve only heard Bruch on recording, watch the soloist dig into the strings: this is music to play while tossing your hair.
The popularity of this showpiece has never flagged, especially with violin aficionados. Yet even with performances seemingly in every concert hall, Bruch suffered economic privation throughout his life. Small wonder he was embittered by this concerto’s success. “Nothing compares with the laziness, stupidity and dullness of many German violinists,” he wrote to his publisher. “Every fortnight another one comes to me wanting to play the First Concerto; I have now become rude, and tell them: ‘I cannot listen to this concerto any more—did I perhaps write just one? Go away, and play my other concertos, which are just as good, if not better.'”
